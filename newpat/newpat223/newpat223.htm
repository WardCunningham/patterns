But in certain cases it is still necessary to build larger parking lots or parking structures. The environment can tolerate these larger lots and structures, provided that they are built so that they do not pollute the land around them.</p>
<p>This is a simple biological principle. In the human body, for example, there are waste products; the waste products are part of the way the body works, and obviously they must have a place. But the stomach and colon are built in such a way as to shield the other internal organs from the poisons carried by the wastes.</p>
<p>The same is true in a city. At this moment in history the city requires a certain limited amount of parking; and for the time being there is no getting away from that. But the parking must be built in such a way that it is shielded - by shops, houses, hills of grassy earth, walls, or any other buildings of any kind - anything, so long as the interior of the parking structure and the cars are not visible from the surrounding land. On ground level, the shield is especially critical. Shops are useful since they generate their own pedestrian scale immediately. And since the need for parking often goes hand in hand with commercial development, shops are often very feasible economically.

<p><i>A shielded parking structure.</i></p>
And of course, the houses themselves can serve the same function. In Paris, many of the most charming and beautiful apartment houses are arranged around courtyards, which permit parking inside, away from the street. There are few enough cars, so that they don't destroy the courtyard, for the houses; and the street is left free of parked cars entirely.
<p>Along with the need to shield parking structures there is the equally pressing need on the part of a driver to be able to spot the parking structure quickly - and see how it is connected to the building he is headed for. One of the most frequent complaints about the parking near a building is not that it is too far away, but that you don't know where you can go to find a parking spot and still be sure of how to get back into the building.</p>
<p>This means that:</p>
<p>1. Parking, which is specifically for the use of visitors, must be clearly marked from the directions of approach, even though the structure as a whole is shielded. The person who is coming by car will be looking for the building, not the parking lot. The entrance to parking must be marked as an important entrance - a gate - so that you can see it automatically, in the process of looking for the building. And it must be placed so that you find it about the same time that you see the building's main entrance.</p>
<p>2. While you are parking your car you must be able to see the exit from the parking area which will lead you into the building. This will let you search for the closest spots, and will mean that you don't have to walk around searching for the exit.</p>

<p>Summary 1:  Windows with a sharp edge where the frame meets the wall create harsh, blinding glare, and make the rooms they serve uncomfortable.</p>
<p>Summary 2: Make the window frame a deep, splayed edge: about a foot wide and splayed at about 50 to 60 degrees to the plane of the window, so that the gentle gradient of daylight gives a smooth transition between the light of the window and the dark of the inner wall.</p>
<p>Summary 3: A window is always much brighter than an interior wall; and the walls tend to be darkest next to the window&#039;s edge.</p>
<p>Summary 4: The splayed reveal then creates a transition area - a zone of intermediate brightness - between the brightness of, the window and the darkness of the wall.</p>
<p>Summary 5: In empirical studies of glare, Hopkinson and Petherbridge have found: that the larger the reveal is, the less glare there is; the reveal functions best, when its brightness is just halfway between the brightness of the window and the brightness of the wall.</p>
<p>Summary 6: Build the depth of the frame so that it is continuous with the structure of the walls - FRAMES AS THICKENED EDGES; if the wall is thin, make up the necessary depth for the reveal on the inside face of the wall, with bookshelves, closets or other THICK WALLS; embellish the edge of the window even further, to make light even softer, with lace work, tracery, and climbing plants - FILTERED LIGHT, HALF-INCH TRIM, CLIMBING PLANTS.....</p>
